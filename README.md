# SyncIt Bootstrap

A base SyncIt project with SyncIt, SyncItControl and SyncItServer all integrated... with only a very slight jQuery dependency (which will be easy to remove).

It is highly likely some of this will get split out into seperate projects or integrated directly into SyncIt / SyncItControl.
